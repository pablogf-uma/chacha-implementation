<h1 align="center">ChaCha20 Implementation</h1>

This repository contains a C implementation of the stream cipher algorithm ChaCha20.

The program contains 5 test vectors (3 from RFC 8439) that confirm the correct functioning of the encryption algorithm.

The throughput of the cryptosystem is 135.5 MB/second with an i7-13620H Intel processor.

Performs 2.5 million encryptions for different 512-bit plaintexts in 1 second.
